The assumption we are making about the Ultimate managers is that they want to increase city revenue streams. Previously one of the revenue streams was the toll bridge and removing that would remove that revenue stream. However, the question to ask is whether the increased economic activity due to more drivers willing to drive people to another city would compensate the loss in revenue due to no toll being in place."
